  <td>Bacon</td>

  <td> <b>1:</b> Bacon should be started in a cold pan, so before you turn on the heat,<br>
     lay out your strips on the pan. You can place them so they are touching and crowd<br>
      the pan a little as the bacon will shrink as it cooks but do not overlap too much.<br><br>
      Bacon cooks best slowly over low heat, so turn your burner on low.<br>
       Soon the bacon will begin to release some of its fat. When it starts to buckle and curl,<br>
        use the tongs to loosen the strips and turn each slice to cook on the other side.<br>
         Keep flipping and turning the bacon so that it browns evenly.<br><br>
         Pour off grease carefully: If the bacon is very fatty and your pan is<br>
         filling up with grease, you can remove some by carefully suctioning it<br>
          off with a bulb baster and squeezing it into a glass or metal container.<br>
           Some people just spoon off the excess with a metal spoon. You can also<br>
            pour off some of the grease but be very careful when you do this as<br>
             spilled grease can cause a grease fire. I usually turn off the flame<br>
              when I pour off the grease and I check be sure that none of it has<br>
               dribbled down the sides of the pan. In any case, be sure that you<br>
                pour it into a sturdy glass, metal, or ceramic container.<br><br>
                Cook until the bacon is done: When is the bacon done? That depends.<br>
                 Some people like their bacon extra crispy and others like it a little <br>
                  loose and flappy. It's important to know that your bacon will continue <br>
                   to cook some when you pull it from the pan and will stiffen up a little <br>
                    upon cooling. <br>
                 In general you will want to see even browning<br>
                  and make sure that the meat part has lost some<br>
                   of its raw redness.<br><br>
                   Let the cooked bacon drain: Using your tongs, remove the pieces<br>
                    from the pan and onto your paper bag/towels or newspapers to drain.<br><br>
                    Cook the remaining bacon in batches: If you have more bacon to cook, <br>
                     you can simply drain the excess grease and add more bacon as you remove pieces.<br>
                     If the pan has developed a browned crust on the bottom,<br>
                      let the pan cool down and wipe it clean before continuing.<br><br>

<td>Pancakes</td>

<td> Great pancakes start with a great batter. A well-seasoned,<br>
   well-balanced batter, mixed properly (yes, there’s a way to do that)<br>
    makes for a perfect pancake every time.<br>
   The instructions below are for a classic buttermilk pancake,<br>
    but we’ll take you through flour experiments and mix-ins later on. <br><br>
    The correct ratio of eggs to buttermilk will create a tangy, custard-like interior;<br>
     there is no true rule of thumb for this, but our master recipe below will give you a good template.<br>
      Baking powder and baking soda will build the ideal lift and a light texture,<br>
       and the right amount of sugar will help crisp the edges without crossing into dessert territory.<br>
        And yes, there is quite a bit of salt. But if you try to cut back, you will miss it. As with any food,<br>
         pancakes need proper seasoning.<br><br>
         Whisk all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then create a well in the center to pour the <br>
          buttermilk and crack the eggs (no need to combine the eggs with the buttermilk first <br>
           – there are only so many mixing bowls you should wash this early in the day). <br>
            Starting from the center and moving towards the edges, incorporate all the dry ingredients <br>
              This develops gluten, which will make a tough pancake. Do not be afraid of a few lumps here.<br>
               They’ll take care of themselves.<br><br>
               Cooking pancakes properly requires patience and all your senses. Listen for the slight sizzle as the<br>
                batter hits the skillet, look for tiny bubbles forming on top, and smell for browning (before it burns).<br><br>
                Finding the correct heat setting for cooking pancakes, which is medium-low, is tricky.<br>
                 Too hot, and you’ll likely burn the exteriors before the insides get cooked; too low and there<br>
                  will be no sizzle and no crispy edges. The temperature truly does need to be just right.<br>
                   Most oven burners are so different that medium-low is not an exact science,<br>
                    so play in the space somewhere in the middle of your middle and lowest setting.<br>
                     When using a large cast-iron skillet or griddle, heat it on low for a few minutes to get<br>
                      the heat evenly distributed. Just before ladling in your batter, turn it up to medium–low.<br>
                      To test if the skillet is ready, hit it with a small spoonful of batter. It should sizzle right away.<br>
                       If it doesn’t, turn the heat up just slightly. If the skillet starts to smoke, the heat is too high,<br>
                        so turn off the burner and wait a few minutes before trying again.<br><br>
                        It should go without saying, but pancakes are not the time to use restraint,<br>
                         especially when it comes to your cooking fat. This is by no means a deep fry,<br>
                          but you do need plenty of fat to get the exterior properly browned and those<br>
                           edges wonderfully crisped, which are arguably the best part.<br>
Yes, we all love butter, and it definitely belongs inside and on top of your pancakes.<br>
 But butter will burn at the heat needed to cook a proper pancake, so choose an oil with a high smoke point.<br>
  Vegetable or canola will do, but if you can get your hands on some coconut oil (refined or unrefined),<br>
   you’ll be rewarded with an almost buttery flavor and delightfully subtle, nutty, tropical vibes. Avoid olive oil, though.<br><br>
   The perfectly sized pancake cooked at home falls somewhere between the ones you might find at your<br>
    favorite breakfast spot and the gimmicky silver-dollar pancake: about 4 inches across,<br>
     the diameter of a generously sized orange. The best tool for ladling out properly-sized pancakes<br>
      is a measuring cup, either 1/4 or 1/3 cup, depending on your preference.<br>
When scooping the batter into the skillet, resist the temptation to make too<br>
 many pancakes at once. The batter will spread and puff slightly, so make<br>
  sure you are spacing them about 1 inch apart. This gives them room to grow<br>s
   without bleeding into each other, and it gives you plenty of space to flip.<br><br>
   For good flipping technique, timing is everything. Wait too long and you’ve got blackened bottoms,<br>
    but be too impatient and you’ll end up with a mess of batter everywhere.<br>
     Each side will take about 2 to 3 minutes, but look for visual cues as well.<br>
As the pancake cooks, the top will start to form many tiny bubbles and appear just set around the edges.<br>
 You can always give it a little peek, but avoid moving the pancakes around too much during this stage.<br>
  The baking soda and baking powder need time to activate and create gas, which makes air, which makes for a delightfully fluffy pancake.<br><br>
  Your reward for being the cook is a pancake called “the tester.” This is the first pancake of the lot,<br>
   and it will almost certainly not turn out well. But do not let this get you down, because it is a<br>
    blessing in disguise: a chance to make a misshapen, slightly burned and poorly flipped pancake,<br>
     and learn from your mistakes. Adjust your heat, increase the fat in the pan if need be, and keep cooking.<br><br>
